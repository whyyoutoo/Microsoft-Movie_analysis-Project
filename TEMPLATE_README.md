# Movie Trend Analysis

**Authors**: Wesley Yu

## Overview

This project analyzes data from various movie databases. Exploratory data analysis of the database shows how trends in movie release dates, genres, and production budget can effect the movie's worldwide box office results. Microsoft can use this analysis to help decide which film projects to take on.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is making their entry into the movie buisness and wants to know what kind types of films are currently dominating the box office. Using data from movie databases, we can find patterns and trends that can help Microsoft in deciding what movie to make how how to ensure it will be successful.

## Data

In this project, we will be looking at datasets from two sources. The Numbers and TMDB.
The Numbers has been tracking data about the movie industry since 1997, having the most up to date information on box office numbers and movie financials.
TMDB is a community built and backed database on movies and TV shows. Data is constanly added and updated by a strong community that is passionate about movie and TV show data.
We will be looking at data from movies released from 2009 to now. The main variables we will be examing are genre, release date, and production budget of various movies.

Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis to find measures of central tendency in different variables that contribute to a movie's success. 

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

The movies with adventure genre has been shown to have higher worldwide box office gross than other genre categories.

Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
